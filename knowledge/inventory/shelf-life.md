# Shelf Life and Perishable Management

## Shelf Life Categories

### Ultra-Perishable (1-3 days)
- Fresh milk, curd, paneer
- Fresh vegetables (leafy greens, tomatoes)
- Fresh fruits (bananas, mangoes when ripe)
- Fresh flowers
- Freshly prepared food (sweets, snacks)

**Management:** Buy daily or alternate days. No bulk purchase. Track by date rigorously. Markdown by afternoon if unsold. Sell at cost rather than waste.

### Short-Life (1-4 weeks)
- Bread, buns, bakery items (3-7 days)
- Indian sweets like barfi, ladoo (5-15 days)
- Eggs (2-3 weeks refrigerated)
- Packaged paneer, tofu (7-14 days)
- Fresh juice (3-5 days)

**Management:** Weekly ordering. FIFO strictly. Check expiry on every delivery. Remove from shelf 2-3 days before expiry for discount sale.

### Medium-Life (1-6 months)
- Packaged snacks (namkeen, chips, biscuits): 2-6 months
- Packaged milk (UHT/tetra): 3-6 months
- Cooking oil (opened): 2-3 months
- Spice powders (opened): 2-4 months
- Personal care (opened products)

**Management:** Monthly stock review. Rotate stock on shelves (new stock behind, old stock front). Order based on reorder point formula. Watch for seasonal demand variation.

### Long-Life (6+ months)
- Canned goods: 1-3 years
- Dry goods (rice, dal, flour): 6-12 months
- Packaged salt, sugar: 1-2 years
- Sealed cooking oil: 12-18 months
- Cleaning products: 1-3 years
- Hardware items: No expiry (but can corrode/degrade)

**Management:** Quarterly review. Safe to buy in bulk for discounts. Still apply FIFO. Watch for packaging damage, pest infestation.

## FIFO is Non-Negotiable

First In, First Out. Always sell the oldest stock first. See `fifo-basics.md` for details.

## Markdown Strategies

| Time to Expiry | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 25% shelf life remaining | Move to front of shelf, prominent display |
| 10-15% shelf life remaining | Apply 10-20% discount, bundle with other products |
| Last 3-5 days | Sell at cost or small loss. Better than total waste |
| Expired | NEVER sell. Remove, record as wastage, dispose |

## Wastage Tracking

Track every item discarded due to expiry or damage:
- **What** was wasted (item name, quantity)
- **Why** (expired, damaged, pest, returns)
- **Cost** (purchase price of wasted items)
- **Date** of disposal

Review wastage monthly. If any category exceeds 2-3% of purchases, reduce order quantities or frequency for that item.

## Storage Tips for Indian Climate

- **Keep cool and dry:** Indian summers (40C+) destroy shelf life. Invest in basic ventilation
- **Monsoon protection:** Elevate stock off floor (use pallets/shelves). Moisture damages packaging and attracts pests
- **Pest control:** Seal grain/flour in airtight containers. Regular pest checks
- **Refrigeration:** For dairy and fresh items, even a basic fridge extends life 3-5x. Worth the electricity cost
