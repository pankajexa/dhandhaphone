# Inventory Management for Small Business

## Why Track Stock

- **Prevent stockouts:** Lost sales when customers cannot find what they want. They go to your competitor
- **Prevent overstocking:** Cash locked in unsold goods. Risk of expiry, damage, or obsolescence
- **Know your actual profit:** You cannot calculate real margins without knowing cost of goods sold
- **Make informed buying decisions:** Data beats gut feeling for reordering
- **Reduce theft and shrinkage:** Tracked inventory surfaces discrepancies early

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | What It Tells You |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Inventory Turnover | Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value | How many times stock is sold and replaced per year. Higher = better |
| Days of Inventory | 365 / Inventory Turnover | How many days current stock will last |
| Carrying Cost | ~20-30% of inventory value per year | Total cost of holding stock (storage, insurance, expiry, capital) |
| Stockout Rate | Stockout Events / Total Orders | How often you fail to fulfill demand |

## Simple Approaches by Business Type

**Kirana / Grocery:**
Track top 50 SKUs by sales volume (they likely drive 80% of revenue). Use simple min-max reorder levels. Focus on perishables to minimize waste.

**Hardware / Building Materials:**
Track by category (plumbing, electrical, paint, cement). Seasonal demand patterns matter. Keep safety stock for items with long supplier lead times.

**Garments / Fashion:**
Track by style-size-color combination. Seasonal clearance is critical. Dead stock after season = loss. Move slow items with discounts early.

**Electronics / Mobile:**
Track by model. Watch for new model launches (old stock loses value fast). Warranty tracking matters. Low SKU count but high per-item value.

**Restaurant / Food:**
Daily tracking of perishables is essential. Track usage rates, not just purchase. Calculate food cost ratio weekly (ideally under 30-35% of revenue).
