# FIFO: First In, First Out

## What It Means

Sell or use the oldest stock first. The first items that came into your shop should be the first items that go out to customers.

## Why It Matters

1. **Prevents expiry waste:** Older stock gets sold before it expires
2. **Accurate costing:** Your cost of goods sold reflects actual purchase prices in order
3. **Consistent quality:** Customers always get the freshest available stock
4. **Reduces dead stock:** Nothing sits at the back of the shelf forgotten for months
5. **Tax compliance:** FIFO is the standard inventory valuation method accepted by tax authorities

## How to Implement Physically

### Shelf Loading (Front-Loading Method)
- When new stock arrives, pull existing stock to the front
- Place new stock at the back
- Customers naturally pick from the front = oldest first

### Date Marking
- Write the delivery date on each batch with a marker
- Use colored stickers for different weeks (red = oldest, green = newest)
- For loose items (dal, rice), label the container with the fill date

### Zone System
- Divide storage into Zone A (sell now) and Zone B (next batch)
- Always pick from Zone A first
- When Zone A empties, Zone B becomes Zone A and new delivery becomes Zone B

## FIFO and Cost of Goods Sold

If you bought 100 units at Rs 10, then 100 units at Rs 12:
- **FIFO:** First 100 sold are costed at Rs 10 each
- This gives an accurate picture of when price changes hit your profit margins
- Useful when prices are rising (common in India due to inflation)

## Common FIFO Mistakes

- **Stacking new stock on top of old** in boxes/sacks -- put new below, old on top
- **Ignoring back-of-shelf items** -- do a weekly shelf check, pull forward anything pushed to the back
- **Mixing batches** in loose containers -- empty the container fully before refilling, or use two containers
- **Not checking supplier delivery** -- sometimes suppliers deliver older stock. Always check manufacturing/expiry dates on receipt

## Quick Daily Routine

1. **Morning:** Check front-of-shelf items for expiry dates
2. **On delivery:** New stock goes behind existing stock. Verify dates
3. **Evening:** Pull forward any items that got pushed back during the day
4. **Weekly:** Full shelf walk -- check every section for date compliance
