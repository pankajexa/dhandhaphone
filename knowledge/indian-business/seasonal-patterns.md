# Seasonal Business Patterns in India

Four major seasons drive business cycles. Understanding them helps with inventory planning, credit management, and cash flow.

## Monsoon Season (June - September)

**Winners:** Agriculture inputs, umbrellas, rainwear, indoor entertainment, packaged food
**Losers:** Construction, outdoor events, transport-dependent businesses

- Agriculture gets a boost: fertilizer, seeds, equipment demand peaks
- Construction slows dramatically: cement, sand, bricks demand drops 30-40%
- Perishable supply chain disruptions: prices of vegetables/fruits become volatile
- Cash flow tightens for rural businesses waiting for harvest
- Road transport delays increase lead times for inventory

**Action:** Reduce inventory of weather-sensitive goods. Stock up on monsoon essentials. Tighten credit for construction-linked customers.

## Festive Season (October - November)

**Winners:** Almost everyone -- retail, electronics, garments, jewelry, FMCG, sweets
**Losers:** Very few. Perhaps health/fitness.

- **Highest consumer spending** period in India. Navratri, Dussehra, Diwali, Chhath
- Demand spikes 2-5x for sweets, clothing, electronics, home goods
- Credit extensions are highest -- customers buy on udhaar for festivals
- Working capital needs peak. Arrange short-term credit in advance
- Supplier lead times increase; order early

**Action:** Stock up 3-4 weeks before Navratri. Extend credit cautiously with clear repayment dates. Hire temporary help. Push slow-moving stock with festive discounts.

## Wedding Season (November - February, also Apr-May/Jun)

**Winners:** Catering, decoration, jewelry, garments, tent-house, event services, sweets
**Losers:** Routine retail may see dip as spending shifts to weddings

- An estimated **10 million weddings** happen in peak wedding months
- Each wedding involves 20-50 vendors across multiple categories
- Bulk orders with tight deadlines are common
- Payment may be delayed (families often settle post-event)
- February has an overlap with financial year-end planning

**Action:** Build relationships with wedding planners and caterers for bulk referrals. Require advance payment or deposits for wedding orders. Keep extended hours during muhurat dates.

## Summer Season (April - June)

**Winners:** Beverages (cold drinks, lassi, ice cream), education (school supplies, admissions), travel/tourism, ACs and coolers, water purifiers
**Losers:** Heavy clothing, hot beverages, some construction (extreme heat)

- School reopening drives stationery, uniforms, and textbook sales
- Summer vacations boost travel, tourism, and hospitality
- Beverage sales peak: cold drinks, packaged water, ice cream
- Agricultural off-season (between rabi harvest and kharif sowing)
- Financial year just ended (April 1): good time to review annual business performance

**Action:** Stock cooling products early (March). Offer school-season bundles. Use the relative lull to do inventory audit and clear dead stock.
