# Credit Culture in Indian Business (Udhaar)

## How Udhaar Works

Udhaar (informal credit) is the backbone of Indian SMB commerce. It is not a flaw -- it is the system.

- **Verbal agreements** are the norm; written records are rare outside cities
- **Trust-based:** Creditworthiness is judged by personal reputation, family standing, and community connections -- not CIBIL scores
- **No interest charged** in most cases (unlike formal lending)
- **Reciprocal:** Today's creditor may be tomorrow's borrower. The relationship is mutual
- **Default is personal** -- a missed payment damages family honor, not just business reputation

## Typical Payment Cycles

| Customer Type | Payment Cycle | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Daily wage labor | Weekly | Pay on Saturday or when job completes |
| Retail consumers (kirana) | Monthly (15th or 1st) | Aligned with salary cycles |
| Wholesale buyers | 15-45 days | Depends on relationship length |
| Restaurants/hotels | Weekly or bi-weekly | Regular repeat orders |
| Contractors/builders | Milestone-based | Tied to project stages |
| Agricultural buyers | Seasonal | Post-harvest payment, 3-6 month cycles |
| Government/institutional | 60-90+ days | Slow but reliable once processed |

## Why Relationships Matter More Than Enforcement

- **Repeat business:** A customer who buys on credit today comes back tomorrow. Losing them over Rs 500 costs you Rs 50,000 in annual revenue
- **Community reputation:** Being known as "flexible" brings more customers via word-of-mouth
- **Network effects:** One customer's family, friends, and neighbors are all potential customers
- **No legal recourse anyway:** For small amounts, courts are impractical. Enforcement depends on social pressure

## Collection Strategy (Escalation Pattern)

### Stage 1: Gentle Reminder (Day 1-7 past due)
- Casual mention during next visit: "Bhaiya, pichhla hisaab baki hai"
- WhatsApp message with amount and date
- Tone: Friendly, assumes they simply forgot

### Stage 2: Firm Ask (Day 7-30 past due)
- Direct phone call with specific amount and date
- Visit their shop/home if reachable
- Mention your own obligations: "Mujhe bhi apne supplier ko dena hai"
- Tone: Respectful but clear this cannot wait

### Stage 3: Social Pressure (Day 30-60 past due)
- Involve a mutual contact or community elder
- Mention to common suppliers or acquaintances (subtle reputation pressure)
- Offer partial payment plan: "Thoda thoda de do, chalega"
- Tone: Disappointed but still respectful

### Stage 4: Hard Stop (60+ days past due)
- Stop extending further credit. Cash-only going forward
- Send written/WhatsApp notice with full accounting
- In extreme cases: involve panchayat or local business association
- Legal notice only for very large amounts (rarely used for SMB amounts)

## Practical Tips

1. **Record every transaction** the moment it happens -- even verbal agreements should go in your ledger
2. **Set soft limits per customer** -- know the maximum credit you can afford to lose from each person
3. **Align collection with pay cycles** -- remind a salaried customer on salary day, a farmer post-harvest
4. **Offer small incentives** for on-time payment: "2% discount for cash payment"
5. **Never embarrass publicly** -- Indian credit culture values dignity. Aggressive public shaming will lose you the customer AND their network
6. **Festival season = collection season** -- people have money during Diwali/Onam. Time your asks
7. **New customers:** Start with small credit limits, increase based on payment history
8. **Keep family relationships** in mind -- the customer's brother or father may be a bigger buyer
