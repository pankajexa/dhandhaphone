# Indian SMB Landscape

## Scale

- **63 million+ MSMEs** in India, contributing ~30% of GDP
- Vast majority are **micro enterprises** (investment under Rs 1 Cr, turnover under Rs 5 Cr)
- Over 90% are **informal/unorganized** -- no formal accounting, cash-dominant
- Employ **110 million+ people**, second only to agriculture

## Key Characteristics

- **Family-run:** Most are sole proprietors or family partnerships, multi-generational
- **Cash-heavy:** Despite UPI growth, cash still dominates wholesale and rural transactions
- **Relationship-driven:** Business runs on trust (bharosa), repeat customers, personal connections
- **Credit-dependent:** Udhaar (informal credit) is standard practice, not an exception
- **Low-margin, high-volume:** Typical kirana store operates on 5-15% margins

## Digital Adoption

- **UPI revolution:** 10+ billion transactions/month, widely adopted even by small shops
- **WhatsApp as CRM:** Most SMBs manage customer communication via WhatsApp
- **Smartphone penetration:** 750M+ smartphone users, most run Android
- **Pain points:** Still struggle with inventory tracking, credit management, GST compliance, and bookkeeping

## Common Business Types

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|
| Kirana (grocery) | Daily footfall, thin margins, high SKU count, perishables |
| Hardware/building materials | Seasonal (construction), bulk orders, heavy credit cycles |
| Garments/textiles | Seasonal (festivals, weddings), high markup, fashion risk |
| Electronics/mobile | Brand-driven, warranty tracking, service-dependent |
| Food/restaurant | Perishable inventory, labor-intensive, high wastage risk |
| Wholesale/distribution | B2B, credit-heavy, logistics-dependent, volume discounts |

## What They Need Most

1. **Simple credit tracking** -- who owes how much, since when
2. **Payment reminders** that do not damage relationships
3. **GST compliance** without hiring a CA for every return
4. **Inventory alerts** before stockouts or before goods expire
5. **Business insights** in their own language, not accounting jargon
