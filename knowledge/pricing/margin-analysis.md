# Margin and Markup Analysis

## The Two Formulas (Do Not Confuse)

### Margin %
```
Margin % = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Selling Price x 100
```
Margin tells you what percentage of the selling price is profit.

### Markup %
```
Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price x 100
```
Markup tells you how much you added on top of your cost.

## Why the Distinction Matters

| Cost Price | Selling Price | Margin % | Markup % |
|------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Rs 80 | Rs 100 | 20% | 25% |
| Rs 60 | Rs 100 | 40% | 66.7% |
| Rs 50 | Rs 100 | 50% | 100% |

A "25% markup" is NOT the same as "25% margin." Saying "I add 25%" without specifying which one leads to pricing errors.

**Conversion:**
- Margin to Markup: Markup % = Margin % / (1 - Margin %)
- Markup to Margin: Margin % = Markup % / (1 + Markup %)

## Typical Margins by Business Type in India

| Business Type | Gross Margin % | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Kirana / grocery | 5-15% | Staples at 5-8%, snacks/FMCG at 10-15% |
| Wholesale / distribution | 3-8% | Volume-driven, thin margins |
| Hardware / building materials | 15-25% | Cement low (5-10%), paint higher (20-30%) |
| Garments / textiles | 30-50% | Branded lower, unbranded/local higher |
| Electronics / mobile | 5-15% | Brand-controlled, accessories have better margins |
| Jewelry (gold) | 8-15% | Making charges, not gold price margin |
| Restaurants / food | 50-65% on food | But high operating costs reduce net to 10-20% |
| Pharmacy / medical | 20-30% | Regulated but decent margins on OTC |
| Stationery / books | 15-25% | School season peaks |
| Mobile accessories | 40-60% | Cases, chargers, earphones -- high margin |

## Break-Even Analysis

```
Break-Even Revenue = Total Fixed Costs / Margin %
```

**Fixed costs** for a typical shop: Rent + electricity + salary + loan EMI + insurance

**Example:**
- Monthly fixed costs: Rs 50,000 (rent 20K + electricity 5K + salary 20K + misc 5K)
- Average margin: 15%
- Break-even: 50,000 / 0.15 = **Rs 3,33,333 monthly sales needed**
- That is about Rs 11,111 per day

If your daily sales are below this number, you are losing money.

## Improving Margins

1. **Negotiate with suppliers:** Even 1-2% better purchase price directly improves margin
2. **Reduce wastage:** Expired or damaged goods are 100% margin loss
3. **Upsell higher-margin items:** Suggest complementary products with better margins
4. **Bundle products:** Combine low-margin staples with higher-margin items
5. **Review pricing quarterly:** Input costs change. Your prices should too
6. **Cut carrying costs:** Do not overstock slow-moving items
7. **Track margin per product:** Not all products deserve shelf space. Drop consistently low-margin items unless they drive foot traffic
