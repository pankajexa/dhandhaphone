# Pricing Strategies for Small Business

## Three Main Approaches

### 1. Cost-Plus Pricing (Most Common for Indian SMBs)
Add a fixed percentage markup to your cost price.

```
Selling Price = Cost Price + (Cost Price x Markup %)
```

**When to use:** Commodity goods, groceries, hardware -- where the market expects standard margins.
**Pros:** Simple, ensures you cover costs.
**Cons:** Ignores competition and customer willingness to pay.

### 2. Competitive Pricing
Set prices based on what competitors charge.

**When to use:** Highly competitive markets (kiranas in the same lane, multiple hardware shops), standardized products with MRP.
**Pros:** Keeps you in the game.
**Cons:** Can lead to price wars and margin erosion.

### 3. Value-Based Pricing
Price based on the perceived value to the customer, not just your costs.

**When to use:** Unique products, services, customized solutions, specialized expertise.
**Pros:** Higher margins possible.
**Cons:** Requires understanding customer perception.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Cost Price (CP) | Purchase price + transport + handling + any duties |
| Selling Price (SP) | What the customer pays (before or after tax depending on context) |
| Margin % | (SP - CP) / SP x 100 |
| Markup % | (SP - CP) / CP x 100 |
| Gross Profit | Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold |
| Net Profit | Gross Profit - Operating Expenses (rent, salary, electricity, etc.) |

## MRP Considerations

- MRP (Maximum Retail Price) is the legal ceiling. You cannot sell above MRP
- You CAN sell below MRP -- and often should for competitive products
- Your margin = MRP minus your cost minus any discount you give
- For goods without MRP (loose items, services), you set the price

## Quick Decision Framework

- **Staple goods (rice, dal, oil):** Competitive pricing. Match the market. Margins are thin (5-10%)
- **Specialty goods (imported, niche):** Value-based. Customers have fewer alternatives
- **Bulk orders:** Offer volume discounts but calculate minimum margin first
- **New customers:** Consider a small introductory discount to build the relationship
- **Festival season:** Premium pricing on high-demand items, discounts to clear slow stock
