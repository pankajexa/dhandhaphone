# Price Elasticity Basics

## What It Means

Price elasticity measures how much customer demand changes when you change the price. High elasticity means customers are very price-sensitive. Low elasticity means they will buy regardless.

## Elasticity Categories for Indian SMB Products

### Low Elasticity (Essentials -- Demand barely changes with price)
- **Rice, wheat, dal, oil:** People must eat. They may switch brands but not stop buying
- **Medicines:** Sick people will pay what it takes
- **Milk, eggs:** Daily necessities with steady demand
- **School supplies (in season):** Parents will buy notebooks and uniforms regardless
- **Salt, sugar, tea:** Basic household staples

**Pricing power:** You can pass on cost increases without losing many customers. But competitors selling the same essential cheaper will still pull customers.

### Moderate Elasticity (Regular goods -- Demand shifts noticeably)
- **Branded FMCG (soaps, shampoo, snacks):** Customers switch brands on price
- **Mobile recharges:** Customers compare plans actively
- **Clothing (daily wear):** Will postpone or buy cheaper alternatives
- **Packaged food (biscuits, namkeen):** Easy to substitute one brand for another
- **Hardware (basic tools, fittings):** Will shop around for better prices

**Pricing power:** Limited. Stay within 5-10% of competitors or lose sales. Compete on convenience and service.

### High Elasticity (Discretionary -- Demand drops sharply with price increase)
- **Electronics (phones, TVs):** Big-ticket, heavily comparison-shopped
- **Fashion and branded clothing:** Customers wait for sales
- **Jewelry (non-wedding):** Easily postponed purchases
- **Eating out / restaurant meals:** First thing cut when budgets are tight
- **Home decor, furnishings:** Discretionary and postponable

**Pricing power:** Low. Discounts and offers drive sales. Premium pricing only works with strong brand or unique product.

### Seasonal/Variable Elasticity
- **Umbrellas:** Low elasticity in monsoon (must buy), high in summer (nobody cares)
- **Woolen clothes:** Low in December, unsellable in May
- **Sweets/dry fruits:** Low elasticity near Diwali, high the rest of the year
- **Cold drinks/ice cream:** Low in summer, high in winter
- **Wedding items:** Low elasticity during wedding muhurat dates

## Practical Rules

1. **Essential + no substitutes = you can price higher.** But do not gouge -- it damages long-term reputation
2. **Many competitors + easy substitutes = price to match.** Compete on service, not price
3. **Seasonal demand spike = temporary pricing power.** Stock up in advance to maximize this window
4. **New product with no reference price = set the anchor.** First mover advantage on pricing
5. **Bundle elastic with inelastic items.** Sell dal at market price (draws them in) and earn on spices and snacks (higher margin)
6. **Monitor competitor prices weekly** for your top 20 products. Price gaps of more than 10% will cost you customers
