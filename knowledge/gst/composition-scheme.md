# GST Composition Scheme

A simplified tax scheme for small businesses. Pay a flat rate on turnover, file quarterly instead of monthly.

## Eligibility

- **Turnover limit:** Up to Rs 1.5 crore (Rs 75 lakh for special category states: NE states, HP, Uttarakhand)
- **Service providers:** Up to Rs 50 lakh turnover can opt in (at 6% rate)
- **Not eligible:** Inter-state sellers, e-commerce sellers, ice cream/pan masala/tobacco manufacturers, casual taxable persons

## Tax Rates (on turnover, not on individual items)

| Business Type | CGST | SGST | Total Rate |
|---------------|------|------|------------|
| Traders (goods) | 0.5% | 0.5% | 1% |
| Manufacturers | 0.5% | 0.5% | 1% |
| Restaurants (not serving alcohol) | 2.5% | 2.5% | 5% |
| Other service providers | 3% | 3% | 6% |

## Key Restrictions

1. **Cannot collect GST** from customers -- you absorb the tax
2. **Cannot claim ITC** on any purchases
3. **Cannot issue tax invoices** -- only "Bill of Supply"
4. **Cannot make inter-state sales** (inter-state purchases are fine)
5. **Cannot sell on e-commerce platforms** (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)
6. **Cannot supply non-taxable goods**

## Filing Requirements

| Return | Frequency | Due Date |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| CMP-08 | Quarterly | 18th of month after quarter end |
| GSTR-4 | Annual | 30th April of following year |

## When Composition Makes Sense

**Good for you if:**
- Your customers are mostly end consumers (B2C) who do not need GST invoices
- Your input GST is low (raw material costs are small relative to selling price)
- You want minimal compliance burden
- You are a local shop with no inter-state sales

**Not good for you if:**
- Your customers are businesses that need ITC (B2B)
- You have heavy input costs with GST (your effective cost increases without ITC)
- You want to sell online via marketplaces
- You do or plan to do inter-state business

## How to Opt In

- File **GST CMP-02** on the GST portal before March 31 for the next financial year
- New registrations: Opt in at the time of registration via REG-01
- You can switch out of composition to regular at any time by filing ITC-01
