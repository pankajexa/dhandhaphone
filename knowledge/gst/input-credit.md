# Input Tax Credit (ITC)

## What is ITC?

Input Tax Credit lets you reduce your GST liability by the amount of GST you already paid on business purchases. You only pay the difference.

**Example:** You buy goods for Rs 10,000 + Rs 1,800 GST (18%). You sell them for Rs 15,000 + Rs 2,700 GST (18%). You pay only Rs 2,700 - Rs 1,800 = Rs 900 to the government.

## Eligibility Conditions

To claim ITC, ALL of these must be true:
1. You have a **valid tax invoice** or debit note from the supplier
2. You have **received the goods/services**
3. The supplier has **actually paid** the tax to the government
4. You have **filed your GSTR-3B** return
5. The invoice appears in your **GSTR-2B** (auto-populated from supplier's GSTR-1)
6. The goods/services are **used for business purposes**
7. You are **not under composition scheme** (composition dealers cannot claim ITC)

## Blocked Credits (Cannot Claim ITC)

Even with valid invoices, ITC is blocked on:
- **Food and beverages** for employees (canteen, tea, snacks) unless you are in food business
- **Personal motor vehicles** and related expenses (unless you deal in vehicles or transport)
- **Health insurance and life insurance** for employees (unless mandatory by law)
- **Club memberships, fitness** -- personal nature expenses
- **Travel benefits** for employees (LTC)
- **Construction of immovable property** for own use (not for further sale)
- **Goods/services for personal consumption**
- **Goods lost, stolen, destroyed,** or given as free samples
- **Tax paid under composition scheme**

## GSTR-2A vs GSTR-2B

| Feature | GSTR-2A | GSTR-2B |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Nature | Dynamic (changes as suppliers file) | Static (monthly snapshot) |
| Use | Reference only | Basis for ITC claims |
| Generated | Continuously updated | Fixed on 14th of following month |
| Action needed | Compare with purchase register | Match and claim eligible ITC |

## ITC Reconciliation Steps

1. Download GSTR-2B from GST portal after 14th of month
2. Compare with your purchase register
3. Match invoices: amounts, GSTIN, invoice number
4. Identify mismatches:
   - **In your books, not in 2B:** Follow up with supplier to file their GSTR-1
   - **In 2B, not in your books:** Verify if purchase was actually made
5. Claim only matched and eligible ITC in GSTR-3B
6. ITC can be claimed up to **30th November** of the following financial year

## Practical Tips for SMBs

- **Insist on GST invoices** from all suppliers, even small ones
- **Verify supplier GSTIN** before paying -- use the GST portal search
- **Do not claim ITC** on items you are unsure about; unclaimed is safer than wrongly claimed
- **Maintain a simple spreadsheet** of all purchase invoices with GSTIN and GST amount
- **Follow up monthly** with suppliers whose invoices are missing from your GSTR-2B
- **ITC reversal rule:** If you do not pay your supplier within 180 days, you must reverse the ITC claimed
