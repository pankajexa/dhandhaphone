## Filing Checklist (Monthly Routine)

1. **By 10th:** Compile all sales invoices, credit/debit notes for previous month
2. **By 11th:** File GSTR-1 (or use IFF if on QRMP)
3. **By 15th:** Check GSTR-2B (auto-generated ITC statement) for eligible credits
4. **By 18th:** Calculate net tax: Output tax - Input tax credit = Payable
5. **By 20th:** File GSTR-3B, pay tax via electronic cash/credit ledger

## Practical Tips

- **Never miss GSTR-3B** -- it carries tax payment and attracts interest
- **GSTR-1 accuracy matters** -- your buyers' ITC depends on your filing
- **Use the GST portal ledgers** to track cash balance and credit balance
- **Keep digital copies** of all invoices for 6 years
- **Set phone reminders** for the 10th and 18th of every month
